 Overall, schools with higher budgets did not have better test results in either reading or math. Schools with higher spending rates (645-675 per student) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student)

Smaller and medium sized schools tended to outperform larger sized schools on passing math

Charter schools tended to outperform public schools at almost all categories, but this can be due to either differing school practices or if the smaller student population was a factor
